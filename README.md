A simple Q&amp;A tech application

##Abstract

With the world now connected 24/7, Social media is an interesting phenomenonthat overtook the lives of most connected 
people over the globe. Social media also provides its users to connect with each other as long as they are connected 
at any moment, and any time. But Social media isnâ€™t only about connecting families and friends: looked at one way, 
social media provides an opportunity for businesses, giving them a personalized platform to connect with their customers.

with stackoverflow.com leading the way.These websites are labeled as a Social Q&A.Such websites server as a wateringhole 
for programmers to meet and learn from each others' inquiries and mistakesAll of these technologies are heavily based on a 
well-managed, complex database systems, on which most applications are built upon and rely on.

##INTRODUCTION

Are databases part of our lives? Yes, in every way conceivable.Almost any application we use on a daily basis, whether that be games, Location Based Services applications, Q&Aapplications, etc., involvesone database or another on which the application is built on top. Without its database, these applications cannot function properly (or at all).During this semester, we have the opportunity to build our own database based application of our choice. After much deliberation, we decided to build a Q&A applicationfor the Android ecosystem,much similar to the concept of stackoverflow.com. There are multiple reasons we decided to build such an application: on one hand, the fact that such service involves a heavy use of database on which the whole project will be built upon, will provide us with the perfect opportunity to put our knowledge accumulated during this semester, and our own expertise into an actual and real life application; on the other hand, this project is heavily influenced by our own desire to understand the technologies that famous services used in the software world strive on.


##Project Status

This project is still in very alpha stage, and may or may not be continued depending on the main developers.
This project was intended as a final term project for CMPS 277 database course.
